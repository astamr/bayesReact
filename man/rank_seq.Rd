\title{Rank sequences based on fold-change (FC) score}
\usage{
rank_seq(exp, data_type = "count", path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{Numerical gene expression (or other relevant measure) matrix (Rows = genes, columns = samples). Input should NOT be log-transformed. Examples include raw counts (default), CPM, or TPM values.}

\item{data_type}{character, type of data to normalize and/or scale. Input can be "count" (default), "CPM" (counts per million; TPM can also be used), or "norm_scale_exp" (data already processed using norm_scale_seq()).}

\item{path}{character, directory to save .rds file in. Default is NULL, returning the fold-change score matrix.}
}
\value{
Sample/cell specific rank for each sequence, based on the fold-change (FC) score. Sequences with highest FC scores have the lowest ranks (thus the rank is decreasing).
}
\description{
Function to rank sequences based on FC-score, which is calculated as the difference between the expression of a sequence/gene and the median expression across all samples/cells.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
rank_of_seqs <- rank_seq(exp) # returns matrix with rank (integer) of each sequence for each sample.
}
