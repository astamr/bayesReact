Description: bayesReact is a package to evaluate motif rank correlation
    for a list of ranked DNA or RNA sequences. It leverages complex
    regular expressions for motif definition allowing for evaluation of
    protein-sequence interactions as well as RNA-RNA interactions among
    other applications. The package utilizes bayesian inference and MCMC
    sampling providing reliable uncertainty estimates.
